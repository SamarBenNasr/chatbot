## chatbot
Chatbot is an intelligent chatbot built with Django and integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using Hugging Face for natural language processing. It can understand and generate human-like responses to various queries and is designed to improve over time with the use of external knowledge sources.



Description

This chatbot is designed to provide interactive conversations with users. It integrates an AI-powered RAG model to retrieve relevant information and generate natural, context-aware responses. It has been implemented using Django for the backend and utilizes Hugging Face models to enhance its conversational abilities.

#Key Features:

RAG-based conversational AI powered by Hugging Face

Web interface for easy user interaction

Customizable conversation flows to handle various types of user input


Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: The chatbot uses the RAG model to retrieve relevant information from external sources to enhance the quality of responses.

Interactive web interface: Chat with the bot directly via the web interface with easy-to-follow conversations.


How It Works

The chatbot integrates the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method using Hugging Face models to improve the conversational quality. Here's how it works:

User Input: The user types a message into the chat interface.

Retrieval: The system queries a knowledge base or an external source to find relevant data based on the user's query.

Generation: The chatbot then generates a response using a Hugging Face model to provide an accurate, context-aware reply.

Display Response: The generated response is displayed to the user via the web interface.


The backend is built with Django, and the chatbot leverages the Hugging Face transformers library for advanced NLP capabilities.


Usage
Interacting with the Chatbot: Once the server is running, open the web interface and start chatting with the bot.
